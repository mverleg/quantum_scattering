Quantum scattering
===============================

During my master internship I did a lot of work on atom-diatom quantum scattering code in Fortran and Python. The code was not started by me so I can't make it public, but get in touch if you're interested.

An example of the result, which needs some quantum mechanics knowledge to appreciate:
